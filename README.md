# Cryptography
A repo for all programs written in my Cryptography class.

## Hash Attack
The program executes with no inputs and conducts a Collision Attack and a Pre-Image Attack using bit sizes of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 and runs 50 samples on each of those sizes (for a total of 800 runs).

It gathers results and saves them to an Excel spreadsheet where analysis can be performed.

Roadmap: Build graphs in matplotlib instead of Excel.
