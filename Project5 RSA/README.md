# rsa.py

A program for executing encryption and decryption using RSA values. 

The program will generate p and q values, phi and n values based off of those p and q values, check that their GCD is 1, and then generate a secret d exponent. Values after that were used for passoff of the project; Thus values generated during the passoff were hardcoded in.

## Directions for Running
```
python3 rsa.py
